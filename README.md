# Closest Pair
## A program to find the closest pair in a random, arbritrarily large set of points in a 2D plane. 


To run this program, input the following:
```shell
java FindClosest < yourInput.txt
```

Your input file should begin with an integer representing the number of points, then list each point. 

The MakeRandomPointSet file can be used to generate a random point set of size n within a specified x and y range, and outputted into a text file by using the following input:
```shell
java MakeRandomPointSet n x-range y-range > output.txt
```

This program was made for a Data Structures and Algorithms II class assignment.
